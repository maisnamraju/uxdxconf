The cornerstones of the process are failing fast, getting to market quickly and focusing on a single solid offering as the end result. The value in terms of external revenue comes from the working, sellable product, whilst the early prototypes and product candidates, that did not get used, are thrown away. Might we use the same thinking to create a new thing called concept software?</p>\n<p>Conventional software innovation follows a distinctly different pattern to what other industries use to conceptualise new product ideas. Traditional software prototyping and what is known as concept cars are categorically different approaches to prototyping – with different outcomes. From the customer point of view, concept software has the potential to evolve brand perception, while increasing employee pride internally as the staff gets to work on cool stuff that is showcased to the world.</p>\n<p>In this workshop, Rasmus will outline why succeeding slowly, with a slower market entry has the outcome of multiple products, decreased risk and greater revenue over time. He will provide a framework of how to design great products without the limitations of bringing a finished product to market as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>What you will learn:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Reviewing the benefits of exploring multiple ideas in one unrealistic explorative and often futuristic, prototype</li>\n  <li>How to get those multiple, sellable products to market</li>\n  <li>How to explore beyond your category to build exceptional productsAllowing yourself and your organisation to push experimental product-free prototypes to the customer</li>\n  <li>Removing the fail fast thinking of getting to market fast one product</li>\n</ul>",
